      <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Looking back, I’ve always been deeply interested in how things work. I’ve always enjoy asking “why.” My, what seems to be never ending, curiosity has led me down many paths to get me where I am today. I like to believe and think that it has made me a more creative, responsible, honest, authentic, humble, ambivalent, wiser, and curious person. My many interests and experiences have led me to my unique understanding of the world around me. My primary focus is to have a better knowledge of the universe by understanding people, and in broader terms the psychology and biology of the many internal and external forces around us.  </p>

      <h2>Goals, Achievements, and  Scholarly Interests </h2><br>
         <h3>Goals and Achievements</h3>
         <p>As I continue to strive for my goals, I like to take time to acknowledge how far I’ve come. One of my proudest achievements would be the purchase of my first home at 21 years old. As time continues, I continue to appreciate and value the decision my younger self-made. Although it came with lots of life lessons and downs to match my ups, it has changed my life only for the better. After taking a four-year hiatus from high school, I decided my break was over and that it was time to go back to school. After my first semester, I made the Dean's List. Which is something I hope to continue to do in my further studies. I was also offered an Inclusive Summer Excellence Scholarship, which I gratefully accepted. Some of my academic goals going forward are to complete my B.S. degree in neuropsychology and obtain at least 1 minor degree. Hopefully, after obtaining my bachelors, I plan to attend medical school at The Ohio State College of Medicine. </p>

         <h3>Scholarly Interests</h3>
         <p>I truly enjoy learning new things and diving deeper into areas of interest to discover previous knowledge, create new findings, and open new ways of thinking in these respective fields. Some current interests I am involved in researching and following are integrative men's health, Grayscale effect on problematic smartphone use, front-end website design, multiracial family setting studies, psychology, biology, medicine, and world history.I also hope to get some Doctor job shadowing under my belt within the next couple of years.   </p>

         <p>Some of my hobbies include video games, playing guitar, fermenting mead (honey wine), traveling, hiking, jiu-jitsu, collecting antiques and vinyl, fashion, art, investing, and enjoying cinematic productions. None of which I am an expert, just nurturing my interests in. </p>
