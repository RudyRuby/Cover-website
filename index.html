               <p>April 24' - June 24' </p>
            </h3>
            <p>A lot has happened in a short amount of time. I finished my first semester of university after a 4 year hiatus after graduating high school. I finished on the deans list and was offered, and accepted, a couple scholarships. I also have been making small progress at my condo updating and upgrading things as time goes by. I also adopted a cat who ended up being pregnant! So I am expecting kittens any day now. I have made significant progress at both of my jobs as well. I found out that my university offers study abroad programs and am looking into it for the summer of 2025. I also went the the annual asian food festival in downtown Cincinnati. Which is where I found Paul Kroners self portrait. Life has been good recently.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am current Univeristy of Cincinnati student. I made this website as a final project for my web design class. I also work two jobs and have a cat and a dog. I love traveling and having new experiences. I play electric guitar and enjoying messing around with it when I need a break from everything else going on. Most of my days are spent at work or school, but I always carve out 1-2 hours every day to walk my dog. So I know all the good dog parks and trails near me. </p>

            <p>When I was first told about a website being our final project at the start of the semester, I had no clue what I wanted to do. Part of me still doesn't. But I realized that I had to start somewhere. So I am excited where the website goes and what it becomes, but at the moment I am experimenting around on what works for me. Hopefully I can use this platforfm to work on my design and skills. </p>
